# Vibe-Tutor: Bugs & Issues Log (v1.0)

This document tracks bugs and issues found during the production-readiness testing phase.

| ID | Bug Description | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **BUG-001** | **Voice input button shows even if not supported.** On browsers without the Web Speech API (like Firefox desktop), the "Add with Voice" button was visible but non-functional. | **Medium** | ✅ **FIXED** | Added a check for `window.SpeechRecognition`. If it's not available, the button is replaced with a message saying "Voice input is not supported on this browser." |
| **BUG-002** | **No loading state for AI Parent Summary.** The parent dashboard summary could take a moment to load, showing a blank space which could be confusing. | **Low** | ✅ **FIXED** | A skeleton loader (pulsing bars) was added, which displays while the report is being generated by the Gemini API. This is already present in the codebase. |
| **BUG-003** | **App crashes on certain rendering errors.** An unhandled error in a component could crash the entire application, requiring a manual refresh. | **High** | ✅ **FIXED** | Implemented a global React `ErrorBoundary` component that wraps the main `App`. If an error occurs, it displays a user-friendly fallback screen with a "Refresh" button instead of a blank white page. |
