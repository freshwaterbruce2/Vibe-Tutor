# Vibe-Tutor: Bugs & Issues Log (v1.0)

This document tracks bugs and issues found during the production-readiness testing phase.

| ID | Bug Description | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **BUG-001** | **Focus Timer desyncs when tab is backgrounded.** When the user navigates away from the app or locks their phone, the `setInterval` timer is throttled by the browser, causing the remaining time to become inaccurate. | **Critical** | âœ… **FIXED** | The timer logic was re-implemented to use a `targetTime` (calculated from `Date.now()`). The interval now calculates the difference between the current time and the target time, ensuring it's always accurate regardless of browser throttling. |
| **BUG-002** | **Timer chime doesn't play on mobile browsers.** Mobile browsers (especially Safari and sometimes Chrome) block audio playback that isn't initiated by a direct user action. The chime, triggered by a timer event, was being blocked. | **High** | ðŸ”· **MITIGATED** | The `audio` element is now pre-loaded when the user first clicks the "Start" button. This user interaction "unlocks" the audio context for the page, making it much more likely that the chime will play successfully when the timer completes. |
| **BUG-003** | **Voice input button shows even if not supported.** On browsers without the Web Speech API (like Firefox desktop), the "Add with Voice" button was visible but non-functional. | **Medium** | âœ… **FIXED** | Added a check for `window.SpeechRecognition`. If it's not available, the button is replaced with a message saying "Voice input is not supported on this browser." |
| **BUG-004** | **No loading state for AI Parent Summary.** The parent dashboard summary could take a moment to load, showing a blank space which could be confusing. | **Low** | âœ… **FIXED** | A skeleton loader (pulsing bars) was added, which displays while the report is being generated by the Gemini API. This is already present in the codebase. |
| **BUG-005** | **App crashes on certain rendering errors.** An unhandled error in a component could crash the entire application, requiring a manual refresh. | **High** | âœ… **FIXED** | Implemented a global React `ErrorBoundary` component that wraps the main `App`. If an error occurs, it displays a user-friendly fallback screen with a "Refresh" button instead of a blank white page. |
