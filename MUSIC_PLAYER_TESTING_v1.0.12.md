### If Issues Found:

**For Radio Streaming Issues:**

- Note how many downloads completed (1/5, 2/5, etc.)
- Include any error messages

**For Track Selection Issues:**
- Describe which navigation action failed (next/previous/selection)
- Note current playlist state (which tracks were downloaded)
- Check if audioPlayer.loadPlaylist() was called in logs

## Quick Verification Script

Run this in chrome://inspect console to check system state:

```javascript
// Check localStorage for downloaded tracks
const localTracks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('localTracks') || '[]');
console.log('Downloaded tracks:', localTracks.filter(t => t.downloadStatus === 'completed').length);

// Check download queue status
console.log('Queue status:', downloadQueue.getStatus());

// Check current playback
console.log('Current track:', audioPlayer.getCurrentTrack()?.name);
console.log('Is playing:', audioPlayer.isPlaying());
```

## Version Verification

Confirm you're testing the correct version:

```bash
# Check version in build.gradle
cat android/app/build.gradle | grep versionCode
# Should show: versionCode 13

cat android/app/build.gradle | grep versionName
# Should show: versionName "1.0.12"
```

Or check in app logs:
```
I Capacitor: Deploying Capacitor v7.4.3
I CapacitorApp: App version: 1.0.12 (13)
```
