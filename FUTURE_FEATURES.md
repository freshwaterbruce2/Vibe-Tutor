# Vibe-Tutor: Future Features (Post v1.0)

This document lists potential features and improvements for future versions of the Vibe-Tutor application.

## Version 2.0 Ideas

### 1. Advanced Reward & Point System
- **Custom Rewards**: Allow parents to create custom rewards (e.g., "1 hour of video games," "Pizza night") that can be redeemed with points.
- **Point Accumulation**: Assign point values to completing tasks, streaks, and focus sessions.
- **Redemption Flow**: A system for the student to request to redeem a reward and for the parent to approve it.

### 2. Deeper AI Analytics & Insights
- **Weekly Reports**: Automatically generate and email a more detailed weekly progress report to the parent.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Have the AI analyze data to find patterns, such as "Focus is highest between 4-6 PM" or "Math homework consistently takes longer than other subjects."
- **ADHD-Specific Metrics**: Track metrics like "task initiation time," "break compliance," and "distraction recovery" to provide more tailored insights.

### 3. Gamification Elements
- **XP and Levels**: Introduce an experience point (XP) system where the student can "level up."
- **Daily Quests**: Generate small, achievable daily goals like "Complete one focus session" or "Break down a task."
- **Leaderboards (Optional/Private)**: A private leaderboard to compete against personal bests.

### 4. Goal Setting & Planning
- **Weekly Goals**: A shared space where the student and parent can set 2-3 key goals for the week.
- **Project Planner**: A tool to break down very large, multi-week projects (like a research paper) into phases and deadlines.

### 5. Enhanced AI Companion
- **Progress Awareness**: Allow the AI Buddy to be aware of the student's progress. For example, "I see you finished that tough lab report, that's awesome!"
- **Proactive Check-ins**: If the AI notices a task is overdue or mood has been low, it could offer a gentle, proactive check-in.

### 6. Technical & Platform Enhancements
- **Cloud Sync**: Move from `localStorage` to a cloud-based database (like Firebase) to enable data sync across multiple devices.
- **Push Notifications**: Implement web push notifications for important reminders (e.g., "Your history paper is due tomorrow!").
- **Dedicated Mobile Apps**: Package the application for the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
