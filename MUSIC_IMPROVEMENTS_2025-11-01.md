## Technical Details

### Stream URL Reliability Strategy

Each radio station now includes multiple fallback URLs to ensure maximum uptime:

```typescript
streamUrl: 'https://primary-stream.com/main.mp3',
fallbackUrls: [
  'https://fallback1.com/stream',
  'https://fallback2.com/stream',
  'https://fallback3.com/stream'
]
```

The `audioStreamService.ts` automatically tries each URL in sequence until one works.

### Audio Playback Hybrid System

The app uses a hybrid audio playback system:
- **Native Audio** (Android/iOS): Better background playback and battery efficiency
- **HTML5 Audio** (Web): Fallback for browser environments

Both systems support:
- Multiple fallback URLs
- Automatic retry on failure
- Error reporting with user-friendly messages
- Smooth transitions between tracks

### Music Categories

Current categories with track counts:
- **Lo-fi / Chill:** 5 tracks
- **Anime Music:** 5 tracks
- **Christian Worship:** 5 tracks
- **Classical / Instrumental:** 12 tracks ⭐ (expanded)
