## Quick Test Sequence (30 minutes)

If time is limited, run this subset:

1. ✅ Install v1.0.14 and verify version (tests 1-3)
2. ✅ Visual check - Goals Panel appears correctly (test 4)
3. ✅ Complete 1 focus session - verify Daily Focus increments (test 6)
4. ✅ Complete 1 homework task - verify Daily Tasks increments (test 7)
5. ✅ Unlock FIRST_FOCUS achievement (test 10)
6. ✅ Close and reopen app - verify persistence (test 17)
7. ✅ Check no console errors (test 31)
8. ✅ Quick regression - open AI Tutor, Music Library (test 29)

**If all 8 quick tests pass → likely safe to deploy**
