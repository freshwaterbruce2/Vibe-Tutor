- [ ] Send message with inappropriate word (should be blocked)
- [ ] Check break reminder appears after 30 minutes
- [ ] Verify API calls go through proxy (check Network tab)
```

#### 2. Deploy Backend to Cloud
Choose one:

**Option A: Heroku**

  ? 'https://vibe-tutor-backend.herokuapp.com' // Your actual URL
  : 'http://localhost:3001';
```

#### 4. Build Final APK
```bash
# Rebuild with production URL
npm run build
npx cap sync android

# Open Android Studio
npx cap open android

# In Android Studio:
1. Build â†’ Generate Signed Bundle/APK
2. Choose APK
3. Create or use existing keystore

## ðŸ”’ Security Verification

Run these commands to verify security:

```bash

- âœ… Parent PIN hashed with SHA-256
- âœ… Content filtered for safety
- âœ… Usage monitored and limited
- âœ… Session-based authentication

### Important Reminders:
1. **Keep backend server running** - App won't work without it
2. **Write down parent PIN** - Cannot be recovered
3. **Monitor first week** - Adjust limits as needed
4. **Test on your device first** - Before giving to son
