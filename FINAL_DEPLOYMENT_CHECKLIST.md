- [ ] Try incorrect PIN 3 times (should lock out)
- [ ] Send message with inappropriate word (should be blocked)
- [ ] Check break reminder appears after 30 minutes
- [ ] Verify API calls go through proxy (check Network tab)
```

#### 2. Deploy Backend to Cloud

git push heroku main
```

**Option B: Railway**
1. Go to railway.app
2. New Project → Deploy from GitHub
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy

**Option C: Render**
1. Go to render.com
2. New Web Service
3. Connect GitHub repo
4. Add environment variables

#### 3. Update Production URL
Edit `services/secureClient.ts`:
```javascript

  ? 'https://vibe-tutor-backend.herokuapp.com' // Your actual URL
  : 'http://localhost:3001';
```

#### 4. Build Final APK
```bash
# Rebuild with production URL
npm run build
npx cap sync android

# Open Android Studio
npx cap open android

# In Android Studio:
1. Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK
2. Choose APK
3. Create or use existing keystore
4. Build release APK
```

#### 5. Install on Motorola Device
1. Transfer APK to phone

## 🔒 Security Verification

Run these commands to verify security:

```bash
# Check API key not in build
grep -r "sk-" dist/

# Should return nothing

# Check PIN is hashed
# Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
# parentPinHash should be 64 character hex string

```

## 📋 Final Notes

### What's Protected:
- ✅ API key secured on server
- ✅ Parent PIN hashed with SHA-256
- ✅ Content filtered for safety

3. **Monitor first week** - Adjust limits as needed
4. **Test on your device first** - Before giving to son
