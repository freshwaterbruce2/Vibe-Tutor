## 🚀 DECISION

### ✅ READY FOR ANDROID BUILD
**If all critical tests passed:**
```bash
pnpm run android:full-build
```
This will:
1. Build web assets (dist/)
2. Sync to Android (android/app/src/main/assets/)
3. Build APK (android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/)

**Estimated time:** 2-3 minutes

### ❌ NEEDS FIXES
If any critical test failed, note the issue and fix before building APK.

---

## 📱 ANDROID DEVICE TESTING (After APK Build)

Once APK is built, test on your Samsung Galaxy A54:

```bash
# Uninstall old version (force cache clear)
pnpm run android:uninstall

# Install new v1.0.14 APK
pnpm run android:install

# Open app and repeat all 17 tests above
# Pay special attention to:
# - Daily obby reset at midnight
# - Card evolution animations
# - Background focus timer accuracy
```

---

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES (Expected)

These are known limitations, not bugs:
- Obby questions repeat after 5 per day (by design)
- Card evolution to Master requires 13 homework tasks
- AI conversation history can grow large (will add pruning in v1.0.15)
- Daily reset requires waiting until midnight (can't test immediately)
