Think of this as your personal teacher. It's super smart and patient.
- **Ask anything**: "Can you explain photosynthesis?" or "How do I solve for x in this equation?"
- **No direct answers**: It's designed to help you *learn*, so it will ask you questions to help you figure out the answer yourself.

## Tips for Success (Especially for ADHD Brains!) ‚ú®

-   **Use the "AI Breakdown" A LOT**: Big projects can feel overwhelming. Breaking them down into tiny steps makes them feel much easier to start.

-   **Fidget During Breaks**: Your 5-minute break is perfect for getting up, stretching, walking around, or doing something physical. It helps reset your brain.
-   **Use the AI Buddy**: If you're feeling frustrated or stuck, take a minute to chat with Vibe. Sometimes just writing down your feelings can help you move forward.
-   **Celebrate Small Wins**: Every time you check off a task‚Äîand feel that little buzz‚Äîgive yourself a pat on the back. You're making progress!
