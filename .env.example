# Vibe-Tutor Environment Variables

# Backend Server Configuration (Required for secure deployment)
# This API key should ONLY be set on the backend server, never in the client
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here

# Server Port (optional, defaults to 3001)
PORT=3001

# Environment Mode
NODE_ENV=production

# SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. NEVER commit the actual .env file to version control
# 2. Keep API keys on the backend server only
# 3. The client app connects to the backend via secure proxy
# 4. All API calls are authenticated with session tokens

# For Production Deployment:
# 1. Deploy backend server to cloud (Heroku, Railway, Render)
# 2. Set these environment variables on your hosting platform
# 3. Update secureClient.ts with your production backend URL
# 4. Build and deploy the frontend app separately
