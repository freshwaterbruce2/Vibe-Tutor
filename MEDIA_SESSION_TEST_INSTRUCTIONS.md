## 🎓 NOTES

**Battery Impact:** None (uses native OS media APIs)

**Compatibility:** Gracefully degrades on unsupported browsers (no errors, just no lock screen controls)

**Known Limitations:**
- Android WebView (Capacitor app) requires native plugin for full support
- Position updates throttled to 1/sec to avoid spam
- Some older devices may have buggy implementations
