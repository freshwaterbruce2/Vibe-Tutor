**Release Date**: October 3, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready - Tested & Verified
**Build**: Clean build from commit `2372825`

## 🎯 What's Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Navigation Buttons ✅
**Problem**: Both desktop sidebar (white background) and mobile bottom navigation (colored buttons) were displaying at the same time on Galaxy A54.

**Root Cause**: Tailwind CSS v4 loaded from CDN uses modern CSS features (`@property`, `color-mix()`) that Android WebView doesn't fully support. This caused media queries like `md:hidden` and `hidden md:flex` to be ignored.

**Solution**:
- Removed Tailwind CSS v4 CDN
- Installed Tailwind CSS v3.4.15 with PostCSS
- Configured proper mobile breakpoints in `tailwind.config.js`
- Result: Only mobile navigation shows on phone screens

---

### 2. Chat Not Working ✅
**Problem**: AI Tutor and AI Buddy chat windows opened but messages wouldn't send or receive responses.

**Root Cause**: Capacitor 7's automatic fetch patching wasn't working reliably. Standard `fetch()` calls were hitting CORS issues in Android WebView.

**Solution**:
- Replaced all `fetch()` calls with `CapacitorHttp.request()`
- Added explicit imports from `@capacitor/core`
- Native HTTP bypasses WebView network stack completely
- Result: Chat messages send and receive properly
