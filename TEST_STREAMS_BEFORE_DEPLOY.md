## K-Love Problem

**Issue:** K-Love uses AAC+ format, NOT MP3
- AAC+ may not work in Android WebView
- Alternative: Use WALM HD (Christian music, MP3, higher quality)
- Or: We can add K-Love but it might say "format not supported"

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test all URLs above in VLC
2. ✅ Tell me which ones work
3. ✅ I'll create new station list with ONLY working URLs
4. ✅ Deploy to phone
5. ✅ Test on phone

**DO NOT SKIP TESTING!** We've wasted too much time deploying broken streams. Test in VLC first!
