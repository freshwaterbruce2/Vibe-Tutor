    {
        id: 'greeting-1',
        category: 'conversation',
        title: 'How to Start Conversations',
        tip: 'Start with simple greetings like "Hey, how\'s it going?" You don\'t need a perfect opening line.',
        example: 'At school: "Hey! Did you finish the math homework? That last problem was tricky."'
    },
    {
        id: 'small-talk-1',
        category: 'conversation',
        title: 'Small Talk Isn\'t Meaningless',
        tip: 'When people ask "How are you?" they\'re showing friendliness, not asking for details. "Good, thanks! You?" is perfect.',
        example: 'Teacher: "How are you?" You: "Good, thanks! How was your weekend?"'
    },
    {
        id: 'listening-1',
        category: 'conversation',
        title: 'Active Listening Signals',
        tip: 'Show you\'re listening: nod, say "mm-hmm," make eye contact (or look near their face if that\'s easier), ask follow-up questions.',
        example: 'Friend: "I went to the movies." You: "Cool! What did you see? Was it good?"'
    },
    {
        id: 'share-balance-1',
        category: 'conversation',
        title: 'Balanced Sharing',
        tip: 'When talking about your interests, share for 20-30 seconds, then check if they\'re still engaged (nodding, asking questions). If not, ask about them.',
        example: 'You: "I\'m playing this new RPG..." (watch for interest) "...have you played anything cool lately?"'
    },

    // Friendship
    {
        id: 'friend-maintain-1',
        category: 'friendship',
        title: 'Keeping Friendships Alive',
        tip: 'Reach out first sometimes. Text "Hey, want to hang out?" or "Saw this meme and thought of you." Don\'t wait for them to always initiate.',
        example: 'Text: "Hey! Want to play [game] this weekend?" or "How\'d your test go?"'
    },
    {
        id: 'friend-boundaries-1',
        category: 'friendship',
        title: 'Respecting Boundaries',
        tip: 'If someone says they\'re busy or need space, believe them. Don\'t take it personally. They\'ll reach out when ready.',
        example: 'Friend: "Can\'t hang out today, I have family stuff." You: "No problem! Maybe next weekend?"'
    },
    {
        id: 'friend-reciprocity-1',
        category: 'friendship',
        title: 'Friendship is Two-Way',
        tip: 'Ask about their life too. "How was your day?" "How\'s your family?" "Did you finish that project?" People like feeling cared about.',
        example: 'Friend helped you? Next time: "Hey, need help with anything? You helped me last week."'
    },

    // Family
    {
        id: 'family-respect-1',
        category: 'family',
        title: 'Why Parents Set Rules',
        tip: 'Parents set rules because they care and want you safe, not to annoy you. Explaining your perspective calmly can help them understand.',
        example: 'Instead of "That\'s not fair!" try "Can we talk about this rule? I feel frustrated because..."'
    },
    {
        id: 'family-chores-1',
        category: 'family',
        title: 'Chores Show Contribution',
        tip: 'Doing chores without being asked shows maturity and helps the family. It also builds independence skills for when you live alone.',
        example: 'Do your chores → Parents less stressed → More likely to say yes to things you want'
    },

    // Gaming & Online
    {
        id: 'gaming-team-1',
        category: 'gaming',
        title: 'Team Communication',
        tip: 'In team games, stay positive even when losing. "Good try, we\'ll get them next round" keeps morale up. Blaming teammates makes everyone play worse.',
        example: 'Team loses: "My bad on that play. Let\'s try [strategy] next time?" NOT "You guys suck!"'
    },
    {
        id: 'gaming-toxic-1',
        category: 'gaming',
        title: 'Handling Toxic Players',
        tip: 'Mute toxic players immediately. Don\'t argue or try to convince them. Report if needed. Your mental health > winning one game.',
        example: 'Someone raging in voice chat? Mute them, type "Focusing on gameplay, chat off" and move on.'
    },
    {
        id: 'gaming-balance-1',
        category: 'gaming',
        title: 'Gaming Breaks Are Important',
        tip: 'Take a 10-minute break every hour (stand up, stretch, drink water). Your eyes, back, and focus will thank you. You\'ll play better too.',
        example: 'After each match or quest, stand up, look out window for 30 seconds, grab a snack.'
