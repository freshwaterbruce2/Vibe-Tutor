## 📊 MODIFIED FILES ANALYSIS (11 files changed)

### Core Application Changes

**1. App.tsx** - Major Feature Additions ✨
- **AI Tutor Conversation Persistence:** Added localStorage saving/loading for tutor chat history
  ```typescript
  // Before: Tutor history reset on every reload
  // After: Persistent conversations across sessions
  loadTutorHistory() → saves to 'ai-tutor-conversation'
  ```
- **New Views Added:**
  - `SubjectCards` view (route: 'cards')
  - `RobloxObbies` view (route: 'obbies')
- **XP Integration:** Tasks now award XP to Subject Cards
  ```typescript
  // When homework completed, calls:
  (window as any).addSubjectCardXP(subject, 10, false);
  ```
- **Enhanced Point System:** Obbies award variable points based on completion

**Risk Analysis:** ⚠️ MEDIUM
- New global window functions may need proper TypeScript typing
- XP system adds complexity to task completion flow
- Need to ensure no race conditions with localStorage writes

---

### Component Updates

**2. FocusTimer.tsx** - Background Accuracy Improvements 🎯
- **Before:** Interval-based timer (lost accuracy when backgrounded)
- **After:** Target-time-based timer (accurate even when app backgrounded)
  ```typescript
  // Old: setInterval(() => setSeconds(s => s - 1))
  // New: targetTime = Date.now() + duration; check remaining = targetTime - Date.now()
  ```
- **State Persistence:** Timer state saved to localStorage
  - Restores active timers after app restart
  - Maintains mode (focus/break) and targetTime
- **Benefits:** Users can lock phone during Pomodoro without losing progress

**Risk Analysis:** ✅ LOW
- Well-tested pattern from web development
- Improves user experience significantly
- localStorage persistence adds resilience

**3. Sidebar.tsx** - Navigation Enhancements 🧭
- **New Navigation Items:**
  - "Cards" (Layers icon) - gradient-accent
  - "Obbies" (Gamepad2 icon) - gradient-secondary
- **Renamed:** "Sensory" → "Settings" (clearer naming)
- **Mobile Optimization:**
  - Changed from `justify-around` to fixed spacing with `gap-1`
  - Added `overflow-x-auto` for horizontal scrolling on narrow screens
  - Added `min-w-max` to prevent button squashing
- **Why:** 9 nav items now → requires scrollable nav on mobile

**Risk Analysis:** ✅ LOW
- UI polish, no functional changes
- Improves mobile UX for narrow devices

### Services Changes

**4. buddyService.ts** - (Details not in diff, check git diff for specifics)
**5. types.ts** - New Type Definitions Added
- `ObbyType`: 'math' | 'science' | 'word' | 'history'
- `ObbyChallenge`: Interface for quiz questions
- `ObbySession`: Tracks daily completion per obby type
- `SubjectCard`: Card evolution system
  - `CardLevel`: 'Basic' | 'Advanced' | 'Master'
  - `SubjectType`: 'Math' | 'Science' | 'English' | 'History'

---

### New Features (Not Yet Committed)

**6. RobloxObbies.tsx** - Gamified Learning Challenges 🎮

**Concept:** Educational "obby" courses (Roblox-style parkour challenges) for each subject
- **4 Obby Types:** Math Parkour, Science Lab Escape, Word Tower, History Timeline Run
- **Daily Challenges:** 5 questions per obby, reset daily (uses date as seed for consistency)
- **Progression System:**
  - Easy questions: 3 points
  - Medium questions: 4 points
  - Hard questions: 5 points
  - Total possible: 15-25 points per obby per day
- **LocalStorage Keys:**
  - `obby-sessions`: Tracks completedToday and bestScore per obby
  - `obby-last-date`: Date tracker for daily resets

**Question Examples:**
- Math: "What is 15 + 27?" (Options: 40/42/45/48)
- Science: "What is the chemical symbol for water?" (O2/H2O/CO2/HO)
- Word: "Which word means 'happy'?" (Sad/Joyful/Angry/Tired)
- History: "When did WWII end?" (1943/1944/1945/1946)

**UX Flow:**
1. User selects obby type from grid
2. 5 sequential challenges appear
3. Correct answer: Green checkmark, +points
4. Incorrect: Red X, shows correct answer
5. Completion: Trophy animation, total score, claim rewards button
6. Daily limit: "Come back tomorrow!" message after completion

**Integration Points:**
- Awards points via `onObbyComplete(type, points)` callback to App.tsx
- Triggers achievement events (potentially TASK_COMPLETED for consistency)
- Stored independently from homework system

**Risk Analysis:** ⚠️ MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Pros:**
  - Highly engaging gamification
  - Encourages daily learning
  - No external API dependencies
- **Cons:**
  - Question bank needs expansion (currently 5 per subject)
  - Hardcoded questions (should be in constants.ts or separate file)
  - No difficulty progression based on skill
  - Daily reset logic may need timezone handling
- **Testing Needs:**
  - Daily reset at midnight (test with device time manipulation)
  - Score persistence across app restarts
  - Concurrent obby completions (all 4 in one day)

---

**7. SubjectCards.tsx** - Pokémon-Style Subject Evolution 🎴

**Concept:** Collectible cards for each subject that "evolve" as you complete homework
- **4 Subject Cards:** Math, Science, English, History
- **3 Evolution Levels:**
  - ⭐ Basic (0-30 XP): Starting card
  - ⭐⭐ Advanced (30-130 XP): First evolution
  - ⭐⭐⭐ Master (130+ XP): Final form
- **XP Sources:**
  - Completing homework: +10 XP
  - Potentially obbies/achievements (not yet implemented)
- **Shiny Variants:** Random chance for rare "shiny" cards (visual flair)

**Evolution System:**
```typescript
Basic (0 XP) → 30 XP needed → Advanced
Advanced (0 XP) → 100 XP needed → Master
Master = Max level (no further evolution)
```

**LocalStorage Key:** `subject-cards`

**UI Features:**
- Grid display of 4 cards
- Click card to view details
- Progress bar showing XP to next level
- Evolution animation when leveling up (via `showEvolution` state)
- Sparkles icon for shiny cards
- Trophy icon shows completion count

**Integration:**
- **Global function exposed:** `window.addSubjectCardXP(subject, xp, isShiny)`
  - Called from App.tsx when homework completed
  - Allows other components to award XP
- **Callback:** `onCardLevelUp(subject, newLevel)`
  - App.tsx awards bonus points (+20) on level up
  - Triggers achievement events

**Risk Analysis:** ⚠️ MEDIUM
- **Pros:**
  - Strong engagement mechanic (Pokémon proven model)
  - Visual progress representation
  - Encourages subject diversity
- **Cons:**
  - Global window function is not TypeScript safe
  - XP balance may need tuning (30 XP = 3 homework tasks)
  - No way to "de-level" or reset (permanent progression)
  - Shiny mechanic not implemented (prop exists but no RNG)
- **Testing Needs:**
  - Level up animations smooth
  - XP carries over correctly (residual XP after evolution)
  - Multiple cards can evolve in same session
  - Data persistence after app restart

| **`subject-cards`** | SubjectCard[] | **NEW v1.0.14** | ~1-2KB | Persistent |

### Storage Growth Analysis

**v1.0.13 Total:** ~25-50KB
**v1.0.14 Projected:** ~35-75KB

**Growth Drivers:**
1. **AI Tutor Conversations:** Largest addition (~5-50KB depending on usage)
   - Each message ~200-500 bytes
   - System prompt ~1KB
   - 10-20 messages = ~5-10KB
   - **Mitigation:** Should implement max message limit (e.g., 50 messages, then summarize/truncate)
2. **Obby Sessions:** Minimal impact (~500B)
3. **Subject Cards:** Minimal impact (~1-2KB)
4. **Focus Timer State:** Minimal impact (~100B)

**Risk Assessment:** ⚠️ MEDIUM
- **localStorage limit:** 5-10MB per origin (browser dependent)
- **Current usage:** <1% of limit (safe)
- **Long-term risk:** AI conversations could grow unbounded
- **Recommendation:** Implement conversation pruning strategy

## 🔗 NX WORKSPACE INTEGRATION

### Current Status

**project.json Location:** `C:\dev\Vibe-Tutor\project.json` ✅
**Root Directory:** `Vibe-Tutor` (at monorepo root)
**Expected Location (per CLAUDE.md):** Should be at `projects/active/mobile-apps/vibe-tutor/`

**Integration Quality:** 🟡 PARTIAL
- ✅ project.json created with all Nx targets
- ✅ Proper tags: `scope:mobile`, `type:pwa`, `platform:android`, `language:typescript`
- ✅ Build/cache configuration correct
- ⚠️ **Location mismatch:** Vibe-Tutor at root instead of `projects/active/mobile-apps/`
- ⚠️ **Note in CLAUDE.md:** "Vibe-Tutor location: Currently at root `Vibe-Tutor/`, should be moved to `projects/active/mobile-apps/vibe-tutor/` when not locked"

**Nx Targets Configured:**
```json
{
  "dev": "nx:run-script",           // ✅ No cache (dev server)
  "build": "nx:run-script",         // ✅ Cached with outputs
  "preview": "nx:run-script",       // ✅ Depends on build
  "start": "nx:run-script",         // ✅ Backend proxy (no cache)
  "android:sync": "nx:run-script",  // ✅ Depends on build
  "android:build": "nx:run-script", // ✅ Cached APK builds
  "android:full-build": "nx:run-script", // ✅ End-to-end pipeline
  "android:deploy": "nx:run-script" // ✅ Full deployment workflow
}
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- ✅ Build caching for faster rebuilds
- ✅ Dependency tracking (android:sync depends on build)
- ✅ Parallel task execution possible
- ✅ Affected-only testing in CI/CD

**What's Missing:**
- ⚠️ Project not in standard location (moveto `projects/active/mobile-apps/` when safe)
- ⚠️ No test targets defined (Playwright tests exist but not in project.json)
- ⚠️ No lint target (should add ESLint configuration)

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# When project is stable (not actively developed), move to standard location:
# git mv Vibe-Tutor projects/active/mobile-apps/vibe-tutor
# Update project.json root: "projects/active/mobile-apps/vibe-tutor"
```

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

### High Priority

**1. AI Conversation Storage Growth**
- **Risk:** Unbounded growth could fill localStorage
- **Mitigation:** Implement max 50 messages, then summarize or truncate oldest
- **Timeline:** Before v1.0.14 release

**2. Obby Question Bank Too Small**
- **Risk:** Only 5 questions per subject = low replayability
- **Mitigation:** Expand to 20-30 questions per subject, rotate daily
- **Timeline:** v1.0.15 enhancement

**3. Global Window Function (TypeScript Safety)**
- **Risk:** `window.addSubjectCardXP` bypasses type checking
- **Mitigation:** Create proper TypeScript interface augmentation
  ```typescript
  declare global {
    interface Window {
      addSubjectCardXP: (subject: SubjectType, xp: number, isShiny: boolean) => void;
    }
  }
  ```
- **Timeline:** Before v1.0.14 release

### Medium Priority

**4. Subject Card XP Balance**
- **Risk:** 30 XP to evolve = only 3 homework tasks (may be too easy)
- **Mitigation:** Monitor usage data, adjust thresholds in v1.0.15
- **Tuning Options:**
  - Increase Basic → Advanced to 50 XP (5 tasks)
  - Increase Advanced → Master to 150 XP (15 more tasks)

**5. Daily Reset Timezone Handling**
- **Risk:** Obbies reset based on device time, not server time
- **Mitigation:** Use `Date.toISOString().split('T')[0]` (always UTC)
- **Current Status:** Already implemented correctly ✅

**6. No Test Coverage for New Components**
- **Risk:** Regressions may slip through manual testing
- **Mitigation:** Add Playwright E2E tests for obbies/cards in v1.0.15
- **Timeline:** Post-release enhancement

---
