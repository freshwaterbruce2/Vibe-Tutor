**Version:** 1.0.21 (versionCode 22)
**Status:** ✅ **INSTALLED ON DEVICE**
**Priority:** CRITICAL FIX - AI Buddy Specialization

## 🎯 Critical Fix: AI Tutor vs AI Buddy Separation

### What Was Broken
User reported that AI Tutor and AI Buddy seemed like the same chat - both were providing generic responses without clear purpose differentiation.

### Root Cause
The `AI_FRIEND_PROMPT` system prompt was too generic:
- Basic emotional support
- Generic encouragement
- No specific focus on social skills or autism/ADHD support
- Seemed redundant with AI Tutor

### What We Fixed

**AI Buddy is now a SPECIALIZED Social Skills Coach** based on 2025 best practices for neurodivergent support:

```
Old: "You are a supportive and friendly AI buddy"
New: "You are Vibe, a specialized AI social companion for high school
      students with ADHD and high-functioning autism. Your PRIMARY PURPOSE
      is social skills development, emotional support, and neurodivergent-
      specific life skills coaching."
```
