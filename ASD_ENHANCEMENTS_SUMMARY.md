# ASD-Friendly Enhancements Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-13
**User:** Age 13, Level 1 Autism (High-Functioning)
**Goal:** Help manage gaming addiction through structured routines and engaging education

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Visual Schedules (Morning/Evening)
**Files Created:**
- `components/schedule/VisualSchedule.tsx` - Tappable routine display with progress tracking
- `components/schedule/StepCard.tsx` - Individual step with timer, microsteps, checkbox
- `components/schedule/ScheduleEditor.tsx` - Parent-controlled schedule creation/editing
- `services/scheduleService.ts` - Schedule CRUD and progress tracking
- `types/schedule.ts` - TypeScript definitions

**Features:**
- Morning and evening routines with customizable steps
- Visual progress bars (completion percentage)
- Built-in timers for each step (e.g., "Brush teeth - 5 min")
- Microsteps for task breakdown (e.g., "Wet brush → Add toothpaste → Brush for 2 min")
- Completion tracking per day
- Token rewards for completing steps (5 tokens) and full routines (20 tokens)

### 2. First-Then Gate
**Files Created:**
- `components/FirstThenGate.tsx` - Access control for Brain Games

**Features:**
- Requires completing X routine steps (default: 3) before unlocking Brain Games
- Configurable by parents (can disable or adjust minimum steps)
- Clear visual feedback with progress bar
- Encouraging messages (not punitive)
- Time-of-day aware (morning schedule 5am-12pm, evening 5pm-10pm)

**Why It Works for ASD:**
- Predictable routine-first structure reduces anxiety
- Visual progress toward unlock (not abstract rules)
- No sudden removal of privileges (gradual unlock)
- Respects special interests (Roblox/games) as reward, not punishment

### 3. Token Economy (Roblox-Style)
**Files Created:**
- `services/tokenService.ts` - Earn/spend token system
- `components/TokenWallet.tsx` - Wallet UI with transaction history

**Token Rewards:**
- Routine step complete: **5 tokens**
- Morning/evening routine complete: **20 tokens**
- Game complete: **10 tokens** (+ bonuses for perfect, no hints)
- Focus session (25 min): **15 tokens**
- Streaks (3-day, 7-day, 30-day): **30-200 tokens**

**Features:**
- Real-time balance display
- Transaction history (earn/spend)
- Today's earnings/spending summary
- Total lifetime stats (total earned, total spent)
- Roblox-style visual design (yellow/orange gradient, coin icons)

### 4. Usage Tracking & Transparency
**Files Created:**
- `services/usageTracker.ts` - Session start/stop tracking

**Features:**
- Tracks time in each activity (games, homework, tutor, schedule, focus)
- Daily/weekly summaries
- Parent-visible transparency (not hidden monitoring)
- Automatic cleanup of old data (30 days)
- Session types: game, homework, tutor, buddy, schedule, focus

### 5. Conversation Buddy
**Files Created:**
- `components/ConversationBuddy.tsx` - Chat interface
- `services/assistantClient.ts` - IPC bridge or backend proxy

**Features:**
- Roblox-friendly tone ("Completing chores is like earning Robux!")
- Interest-led learning (connects homework to game mechanics)
- Life skills coaching (chores, routines, social skills)
- Neurodivergent-optimized responses:
  - 2-3 sentences max (executive function support)
  - Direct, literal language (no idioms/sarcasm)
  - 1-2 emojis only (sensory awareness)
  - Bullet points over paragraphs

**Quick Prompts:**
- "Tell me something cool about Roblox!"
- "How can I stay focused on homework?"
- "What's a good morning routine?"
- "Help me understand this assignment"
- "What chores should I do first?"

### 6. Parent Controls
**Files Created:**
- `components/ParentRulesPage.tsx` - Centralized rule management

**Configurable Rules:**
1. **First-Then Gate:** On/off, steps required (1-10)
2. **Daily Time Limits:** Game minutes, total minutes (with warnings)
3. **Calm Mode:** Animation level (none/reduced/normal), sound on/off
4. **Schedule Required:** Child must have active morning/evening schedule

**Why Transparent:**
- Child can see the rules (no hidden restrictions)
- Parent controls clearly labeled
- Non-punitive framing ("Routine first, games second")

### 7. Backend Database & API
**Files Modified:**
- `backend/server.js` - Added 8 new tables
- `backend/src/routes/vibetutor.ts` - Added 15+ new endpoints

**New Tables:**
- `vibetutor_schedules` - Schedule definitions
- `vibetutor_schedule_steps` - Individual steps with status
- `vibetutor_usage` - Session tracking
- `vibetutor_tokens` - Token balances
- `vibetutor_rewards` - Transaction history
- `vibetutor_interests` - User interests (for buddy chat)
- `vibetutor_parent_rules` - Parent rule configurations

**New Endpoints:**
- Schedule CRUD (`POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /api/vibetutor/schedules`)
- Step status updates (`PATCH /api/vibetutor/schedules/:id/steps/:stepId`)
- Usage tracking (`POST/GET /api/vibetutor/usage`)
- Token management (`GET/POST /api/vibetutor/tokens`, `/rewards`)

## 🚧 Integration Tasks Remaining

### 1. Wire Games to Systems
**File:** `Vibe-Tutor/components/WordSearchGame.tsx`

**Needed Integrations:**
- [ ] Start usage session when game launches (`startSession('game')`)
- [ ] End usage session when game completes (`endSession()`)
- [ ] Award tokens on game completion (`awardGameComplete()`)
- [ ] Wrap game launch in `<FirstThenGate>` component
- [ ] Track high scores per subject in localStorage

**Implementation Points:**
```typescript
// On game start:
import { startSession } from '../services/usageTracker';
const sessionId = startSession('game', { gameType: 'wordsearch', subject });

// On game complete:
import { endSession } from '../services/usageTracker';
import { awardGameComplete } from '../services/tokenService';
endSession(sessionId, { score, wordsFound, timeSpent });
awardGameComplete('Word Hunt', score, perfect, noHints, sessionId);
```

### 2. Update Documentation
**Files to Create/Update:**
- [ ] `Vibe-Tutor/SCHEDULES_AND_RULES.md` - Parent guide
- [ ] `docs/guides/BACKEND-API-GUIDE.md` - Add new endpoints
- [ ] `Vibe-Tutor/PARENT_GUIDE.md` - Update with new features

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Test First-Then gate with real schedule data
- [ ] Test token earning/spending flow
- [ ] Test usage tracking across app restart
- [ ] Test conversation buddy with IPC bridge
- [ ] Test parent controls (enable/disable rules)

## 📊 Evidence-Based Design Decisions

### Why This Approach Works for Level 1 ASD:

1. **Visual Schedules**
   - Research: Visual supports reduce anxiety and improve task completion (Hume et al., 2014)
   - Implementation: Step-by-step visual checklists with progress indicators

2. **First-Then Structure**
   - Research: Temporal sequencing reduces executive function demands (Kenworthy et al., 2014)
   - Implementation: Clear "Do routine → Unlock games" sequence

3. **Token Economy**
   - Research: Token reinforcement effective for ASD when tied to special interests (Charlop-Christy & Haymes, 1998)
   - Implementation: Roblox-style tokens that feel like in-game currency

4. **Interest-Led Learning**
   - Research: Using special interests improves engagement and skill generalization (Winter-Messiers et al., 2007)
   - Implementation: Conversation buddy frames everything through Roblox/gaming lens

5. **Stable Replacement (Not Withdrawal)**
   - Research: Abrupt removal of preferred activities causes stress and behavioral regression (Boyd et al., 2012)
   - Implementation: Same total time, but structured toward learning + routines first

6. **Transparent Rules**
   - Research: Clear expectations reduce anxiety for ASD individuals (Mesibov & Shea, 2010)
   - Implementation: All rules visible to child, not hidden parental monitoring

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### Short-Term (1-2 Weeks)
- Routine completion improves (predictable morning/evening structure)
- Gaming time naturally shifts later in day (after routines)
- Token earning provides immediate feedback loop
- Conversation buddy builds rapport

### Medium-Term (1 Month)
- Routine becomes automatic (no longer needs gate)
- Child internalizes "First-Then" concept
- Uses conversation buddy for homework help
- Parents see usage transparency and adjust rules

### Long-Term (3+ Months)
- Self-regulation skills improve
- Gaming addiction symptoms reduce (DSM-5 criteria: preoccupation, tolerance, withdrawal)
- Life skills generalize beyond app (real chores, time management)
- Positive relationship with technology (tool for growth, not escape)
