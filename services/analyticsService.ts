    Analyze the following student progress data and generate a brief, encouraging report (2-3 paragraphs) for a parent.
    Use a friendly and positive tone.

    Data:
    - Total homework assignments: ${totalTasks}
    - Completed assignments: ${completedTasks}
    - Total student points earned: ${points}
    - Focus sessions completed: ${focusSessions}
    - Breakdown by subject: ${subjectDataForPrompt}

    Instructions:
    1.  Start with a positive and encouraging summary of the student's overall effort.
    2.  Mention the total points earned as a great indicator of their hard work.
    3.  Comment on their focus sessions as a sign of dedication.
    4.  Review the subject breakdown. Highlight subjects where the completion rate is high as areas of strength.
    5.  If any subject has a completion rate below 60%, gently mention it as an area that might benefit from a little extra attention, without being negative.
    6.  Conclude with an uplifting and forward-looking note.
