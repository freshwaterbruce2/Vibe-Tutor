## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Confusing UGC with AI Chat

❌ **Wrong**: "App has user-generated content because users chat with AI"
✅ **Correct**: "App does not have UGC because chat is private and not shared with other users"

### Mistake 2: Overstating Age Range

❌ **Wrong**: Selecting "6-12, 13-17, 18+" to maximize reach
✅ **Correct**: Selecting only "13-17" to avoid Families Policy requirements

### Mistake 3: Inconsistent Age Messaging

❌ **Wrong**: Store description says "for all ages" but target audience is 13-17
✅ **Correct**: Store description mentions "teens aged 13-17" consistently

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Secondary Ratings

Some countries require additional ratings beyond IARC. Check for:
- Iran
- Russia
- Saudi Arabia

These may require manual submission or be unavailable.

## Appeal Process (If Needed)

If your app receives an unexpected rating:

1. **Review the questionnaire answers** - Ensure all were accurate
2. **Check for auto-flagged content** - AI chat might trigger review
3. **Submit appeal via Play Console** - Explain that AI chat is moderated
4. **Provide documentation** - Link to Privacy Policy showing no UGC
5. **Wait 3-7 days** - Google will manually review

**Common Auto-Flags**:
- "Chat" keyword → Flagged as UGC (appeal by explaining AI context)
- "Music streaming" → Flagged for copyright (appeal with Creative Commons proof)

---

## Annual Renewal

Content ratings are NOT permanent. You must:

1. **Renew annually** - Google will email reminder
2. **Re-answer questionnaire** - Takes 5-10 minutes
3. **Update if content changes** - New features may change rating

**Calendar Reminder**: Set annual reminder for [submission date + 1 year]

When releasing new versions:

1. **Review content changes** - Do they affect rating?
2. **Update questionnaire if needed** - New features with UGC, violence, etc.
3. **Re-submit for rating** - Only if content changed significantly
4. **Document changes** - Keep log of rating history

**Examples Requiring Re-Rating**:

- Adding violent game mechanics
- Allowing unmoderated user uploads

**Examples NOT Requiring Re-Rating**:
