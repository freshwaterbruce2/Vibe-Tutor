## Common Unlock Scenarios

### "I Need to Update Vibe-Tutor"

1. Unlock the device using your method's normal unlock procedure
2. Open **Google Play Store**
3. Search for **Vibe Tutor** (or check "My apps & games")
4. Tap **Update** if available
5. Wait for update to complete
6. Re-enable kiosk mode
7. Hand device back to your child

### "I Need to Update Android System"

1. Unlock the device
2. Go to **Settings** → **Software Update**
3. Tap **"Download and Install"**
4. Wait for update (device may restart multiple times)
5. After update completes:
   - **Fully Kiosk**: If "Start on Boot" is enabled, kiosk mode should auto-activate
   - **App Pinning**: You'll need to manually re-pin Vibe-Tutor
6. Test that kiosk mode is working properly

### "I Want to Check What My Child Has Been Doing"

**Option A: View Within Vibe-Tutor (Recommended - No Unlock Needed)**
1. In Vibe-Tutor, navigate to **Parent Dashboard**
2. Enter the **Parent PIN** (set within Vibe-Tutor app, different from kiosk PIN)
3. View homework completion, focus time stats, chat history, achievements

**Option B: Full Device Access**
1. Unlock the device using your method's unlock procedure
2. Access any app or settings as needed
3. Re-enable kiosk mode when done

### "My Child Found a Way to Bypass the Lock"

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Ask your child to show you how they bypassed it (to understand the vulnerability)
2. Common bypass methods and fixes:

   **For App Pinning:**
   - They learned Back + Recents combination → **Switch to Fully Kiosk** (Method 1)
   - They restarted the device → **Set up auto-relock** or switch to Fully Kiosk

   **For Fully Kiosk:**
   - They guessed your PIN → **Change the Admin PIN** immediately
   - They used Safe Mode → **Enable device encryption** and set a strong lock screen password
   - They found a crash exploit → **Update Fully Kiosk** to latest version

3. Have a conversation with your child about trust and screen time boundaries

**Long-term Solutions:**
- Consider upgrading to a professional MDM solution (Miradore, AppTec360)
- Set up device encryption: Settings → Security → Encrypt Device
- Enable Find My Device for remote lock/wipe capability
- Consider physical supervision during device use

### "The Device Restarted and Kiosk Mode Isn't Active"

**For Fully Kiosk:**
1. Check if "Start on Boot" setting is enabled:
   - Unlock kiosk mode
   - Open Fully Single App Kiosk settings
   - Enable "Start on Boot"
2. Grant "Autostart" permission (if available on Samsung):
   - Settings → Apps → Fully Single App Kiosk → Battery
   - Set to "Unrestricted"

**For App Pinning:**
- App pinning does NOT survive restarts - this is a limitation
- You must manually re-pin the app each time the device restarts
- Consider switching to Fully Kiosk for persistent lockdown

## Maintenance Schedule

To keep the kiosk device running smoothly, perform these tasks regularly:

### Weekly
- Unlock and check for app updates (Vibe-Tutor, Fully Kiosk if used)
- Review homework progress in Parent Dashboard
- Check battery health and charging

### Monthly
- Check for Android system updates
- Review and clear app caches if device is slow
- Backup Vibe-Tutor data using the export feature
- Verify kiosk mode is still functioning properly

### As Needed
- Update kiosk settings if child's schedule changes
- Adjust screen time limits if needed
- Update Admin PIN if compromised

---

## Security Best Practices

### PIN Management
1. **Use different PINs** for:
   - Device lock screen (prevents restart bypass)
   - Kiosk mode admin (prevents kiosk exit)
   - Vibe-Tutor Parent Dashboard (prevents settings changes)

2. **PIN Strength**:
   - Use at least 6 digits
   - Avoid obvious combinations (1234, birthdays, repeating digits)
   - Don't share PINs with your child
   - Write them down securely (not on the device)

### Device Security
1. Enable **Find My Device**: Settings → Biometrics and Security → Find My Mobile
2. Enable **Device Encryption**: Settings → Biometrics and Security → Encrypt Device
3. Disable **Unknown Sources**: Settings → Apps → Special Access → Install Unknown Apps
4. Set **Screen Timeout**: Settings → Display → Screen Timeout (to save battery)

### Account Security
1. Remove or secure Google account:
   - Your child shouldn't know the Google account password
   - This prevents app uninstalls and Play Store access
2. Enable 2-factor authentication on the Google account
3. Regularly review account activity

## Important Legal & Safety Notice

**Parental Responsibility**
- Kiosk mode is a tool to support parental supervision, not a replacement for it
- Regularly communicate with your child about device usage and online safety
- Monitor your child's emotional wellbeing and academic performance
- Be prepared to adjust restrictions based on your child's maturity and needs

**Privacy & Trust**
- Consider your child's age and need for privacy
- Explain why you're using kiosk mode (focus on education, not punishment)
- Build trust through open communication
- Respect your child's growing independence as they mature

**Technical Limitations**
- No kiosk solution is 100% foolproof
- Determined children may find workarounds
- Regular updates and monitoring are necessary
- Physical supervision is still the most effective control
